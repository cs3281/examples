In this example we are creating two threads and cancelling the second thread after some time.
Both threads attach clean up handlers. You should see the cleanup handler invoked when we cancel the second thread.
Both threads use pthread_cleanup_pop(1) on the outer handler - therefore you will see that the first handler is always invoked.
