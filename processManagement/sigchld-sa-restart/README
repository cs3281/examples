This example shows the case where the getline is being interrupted by sigchld.
The sigaction API needs to be provided the SA_RESTART flag in order to restart the read system call issued by the getline library function.
If you run the version without SA_RESTART, the getline call will end up in a loop because it will keep on returning an error state. 
The version with SA_RESTART works correctly.
